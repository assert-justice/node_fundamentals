# What Bootcamps Don't Teach You: Node
This is the first episode of a series I'm doing about aspects of computer science that are often glossed over or under explained by coding bootcamps but are invaluable as you proceed in your career. Today we'll be talking about writing a program with a cli, reading and writing files, and launching subprocesses. We'll write an app to add, commit, and push a git repo in a single command. Buckle up!

This talk is designed for people with some experience with JavaScript, especially if you are in or have graduated from a coding bootcamp. If you've written code with Node.js and npm before you should be in good shape. You should have a reasonably up to date version of git and node installed.

You should create a new folder for this project somewhere convenient on your computer. You should also have a code editor. You can use any you like but I'll be using Visual Studio Code. We'll be writing command line scripts and so to ensure those work you should have a POSIX compliant console. If you are on GNU/Linux or OSX your default console is fine. On Windows you should use git bash.

- [Lesson 3: Executing Subprocesses](./_Lesson03.md)

The lessons will often suggest you create a file and add contents to it. All the completed files are in this repo for reference. The code files (those with the .js file extension) are in their final complete form as presented in the lessons.

Happy coding!
